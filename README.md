## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to understand better:
1. What were the most worked programming languages worldwide?
2. What are the top 3 countries who participated in Stack Overflow Survey 2020?
3. What are the top 10 most worked languages in these top 3 countries?

## File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available to show the work related to the questions above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
The main findings can be found available in this [post](https://linnforsman.medium.com/visualizing-most-worked-programming-languages-using-stack-overflow-2020-survey-data-71a09b1484d5).
